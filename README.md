# BASIC Comparision GAN for MNIST using Convnet and Neuralnet


## Deep Convolutionalnet GAN
The below GIF displays the sample of images generated from epoch 1 to 50 at every 5 epochs.

Conv layers enable GANs to generate better images much faster than neural net.

Each epoch takes around 60 seconds

## Deep Neuralnet GAN
The below GIF displays the sample of images generated from epoch 1 to 200 at every 20 epochs.

Neural net enables GANs to generate decent images but after much longer training epochs.

Each epoch takes around 15 seconds.
